# Analysis
Here is a glimpse of the questions that I answered through my analysis:
* How do you count the number of areas that have been damaged?
* What is the area that has been affected by the highest number of hurricanes, and how many times has it been hit?
* Which hurricane caused the highest number of deaths, and how many deaths were caused by it?

The file **hurricane_analysis** contains the full insights that I have uncovered through my complete analysis.
